# Text To Speed Voices

These are samples of Text To Speed (TTS) 
voices available on macOS 12.x. 

The scripts to create the collection are
in the `macOS_12.x/builder` directory. 
The `get-voice-list` bash script is 
run first followed by the `build-voices.py`
python script. 

The out of the scripts is a `voices.txt`
file that contains the list of voices and
test phrases. The `aiffs` and `mp3s` directories
contain the output of the macs `say` command
for each voice with the corresponding 
test phrase. 

The `macOS_12.x/links.html` is a web page
with the samples embeded for easier listening.
